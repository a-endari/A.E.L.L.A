# Installation on Windows

## Prerequisites

- Windows 10 or Windows 11.

## Installation Steps

1. **Download**: Get the latest `.exe` installer from the [Releases Page](../../releases).
2. **Run**: Double-click the installer.
3. **Follow Prompts**: The installer will guide you through the process.
4. **Launch**: The app will open automatically after installation.

> [!NOTE]
> You may see a "Windows protected your PC" (SmartScreen) warning because the app is not code-signed.
> To bypass: Click **More Info** > **Run Anyway**.

## Troubleshooting

- **Antivirus**: Some antivirus software might flag the Python backend. You may need to whitelist the application folder `AppData/Local/Programs/universal-language-app`.
